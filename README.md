System Administrator Assistant

Within the last few decades, the era of computers grew without leaps and bounds, cutting down the cost of computing. But with such a radical growth, too many varied technologies sprouted, to ease the life of application developers and to meet the needs of users with minimal turn around time. Mastering every one of these technologies isn't an easy task and finding developers proficient in a multitude of technologies is also a cumbersome task, not to mention if the technology is anew or grew to be obsolete. With every technology employed in a firm, arises the need for administrators who are primarily responsible for the upkeep and safeguard of these essential building blocks. The day-to-day tasks performed by these administrators are crucial for any firm to make sure their services and transactions are uninterrupted.

Below is [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator#Related_fields) classification of the system administrator into multiple roles depending on the type of technology they deal with.
1. A **database administrator (DBA)** maintains a *database system* and is responsible for the integrity of the data and the efficiency and performance of the system.
2. A **network administrator** maintains *network infrastructure* such as switches and routers and diagnoses problems with these or with the behaviour of network-attached computers.
3. A **security administrator** is a specialist in *computer and network security*, including the administration of security devices such as firewalls, as well as consulting on general security measures.
4. A **web administrator** maintains *web server services* (such as Apache or IIS) that allow for internal or external access to web sites. Tasks include managing multiple sites, administering security, and configuring necessary components and software. Responsibilities may also include software change management.
5. A **computer operator** performs *routine maintenance and upkeep*, such as changing backup tapes or replacing failed drives in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). Such tasks usually require a physical presence in the room with the computer, and while less skilled than sysadmin tasks, may require a similar level of trust since the operator has access to possibly sensitive data.
6. An **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** - takes a software engineering or programmatic approach to managing systems, one of the emerging and promising discipline, aimed to reduce the number of effort developers put into the operations.

The role of administrators is tedious and irreplacable. Higher the complexity of the software the more demanding the job of administrators.

1. **Configuration Manager & templatizer**
2. **Process Manager & Node Explorer**
3. **License Manager**
4. **Job executor**
5. **Entitlement/Account Manager**
6. **Analysis tools**
7. **Plugins for specialized tasks/duties**
8. **Documentation or Knowledge Store**

Agent to collect metrics and other info as well as perform tasks like moving data/files either to a specific location or to a backup storage. This will also be crucial in performing low level task with much more efficiency.
